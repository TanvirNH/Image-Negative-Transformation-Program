- Matplotlib: 3.4.2


## Introduction
- What is Negative Transformation?

- How It Works: 

The output of a picture is transformed to the negative counterpart of the image though the usage of negative transformation.
The intensity levels in a digital picture range from 0 to L-1, and the equation for negative trans- formation can be defined mathematically as, s = L - 1 - r
Negative transformation has a wide range of applications since it aids in the detection of darker areas in a picture; examples include medical imaging and remote sensing, among others.

## The Methodology of Negative Transformation

- When the inputted picture is inverted, each pixel's value 'r' is subtracted from the maximum val- ue L-1, and the result's' is used to replace the inputted pixel.

- The following code shows how the program functions:

- Executing the program:

- After entering the picture file name into the program, an output image is produced that depicts the image's negative transformation, as seen below:
